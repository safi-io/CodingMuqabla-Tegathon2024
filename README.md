# My First Tegathon Experience

Every year, COMSATS University Islamabad, Sahiwal Campus hosts an exciting event known as the **Tegathon**. As a first-year student, this year's Tegathon was my first opportunity to participate in the event, and I was particularly excited about the **Coding Muqabala** (Muqabala means Competition), which is the main and my most favorite event of the Tegathon.

## Introduction

The Tegathon is an annual event filled with various competitions and activities, but the highlight for me was the **Coding Muqabala**. It’s a platform where students test their coding skills under timed conditions, competing against their peers for the top spot. As someone passionate about coding, I was eagerly looking forward to participating.

## My Experience

### Registration and Anticipation

I registered for the Coding Muqabala as soon as I could. The anticipation built up as the event drew nearer. I was excited to test my skills, interact with fellow coders, and see how I measured up in a competitive environment.

### Last-Minute Change of Plans

However, at the eleventh hour, an urgent matter came up, and I was unable to attend the competition. Missing the long-awaited competition was disappointing, especially after looking forward to it for so long.

### Solving the Problems

Not wanting to miss out entirely, I reached out to one of my seniors and got the coding problems from the competition. Determined to prove myself, I set a timer for one hour—the official time limit of the event—and began solving the problems on my own. 

I am proud to say that I completed all the problems within the given time, without any external help. Although I wish I could have experienced the competition atmosphere in person, solving the problems independently was a gratifying experience and a personal achievement.

## Reflection

While I missed the live event, tackling the problems on my own gave me a sense of fulfillment and reinforced my love for coding. I learned that while some opportunities might be missed, the determination to pursue what we love can still lead to success, even in different ways.

I look forward to participating in future competitions and making the most of every opportunity that comes my way.

## Conclusion

The Tegathon and its Coding Muqabala will remain a significant memory of my first year at COMSATS University. Even though things didn't go as planned, the experience taught me resilience and the importance of seizing the moment, whether in competition or personal growth.
