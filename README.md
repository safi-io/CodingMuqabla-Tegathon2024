Ok, so every year my university COMSATS University Islamabad, Sahiwal Campus hosts a Tegathon. Currently, I am in first year, so this was my first Tegathon. The main and my most
favourite event of Tegathon is CODING MUQABALA (Muqbala means Competition). I was very excited to go, and also I registered my self in the event. But at the eleventh hour, plans
changed and due to an urgent work, I missed the long-awaiting competition. So after that, I took the coding problems from my senior and I solved it under 1 hour(Time limit of event).
I completed it without any help, but I wish I went to the competition.
